# 🐒 Tampermonkey Scripts Collection

Welcome to my growing collection of small, chaotic, and occasionally useful Tampermonkey scripts.  
These scripts are built to automate the boring, enhance the web, or just mildly roast you while you scroll through nonsense.

## 📜 What is Tampermonkey?

[Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) is a browser extension that lets you run custom user scripts on websites.  
Think of it as your personal web modding engine — you can tweak, automate, or break websites to your liking.

## ⚙️ Scripts Included

### 💀 [Shame Meter](./shame-meter/shame-meter.user.js)

A brutally honest script that:

- Tracks how long you’ve been on a site
- Shows a floating UI with a timer and progress bar
- Every 15 seconds, serves you a soul-crushing roast
- Motivates through public shaming (it's like therapy, but meaner)

**Use case:** Productivity guilt, accountability, masochism.

### 🤝 [LinkedIn Auto-Accept](./auto-accept-linkedin-requests/auto-accept.user.js)

Auto-accepts all pending LinkedIn connection requests every few seconds.

**Use case:**: Lazy networking, automating the boring.

### 📋 [CI Arifacts Tag Copier](./github-ci-artifacts-tag-copier/tag-copier.user.js)

Copies the Docker Image tag and Helm version tag on GitHub PR Checks page for work repos and adds a copy button for each tag

## 🧠 Why This Exists

Because I like making the web slightly more unhinged, one script at a time.

Some scripts are useful. Some are chaos. All are mine.
