# ðŸ“º Shorts to Watch

> A simple userscript that automatically opens YouTube Shorts in the traditional video player.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why I Built This

YouTube Shorts are fun, but the **vertical UI** comes with limitations:

- No proper comments section  
- No playback speed controls  
- No timestamps, full titles, or descriptions  
- Feels disconnected from the regular YouTube experience

## ðŸ”§ What It Does

- Redirects any YouTube Shorts URL to the normal video player.
- Works on direct page loads **and** internal navigation (YouTube is an SPA).
