# 💀 Shame Meter

> A Tampermonkey user script that sits in the corner of your screen and brutally roasts you every 15 seconds while you scroll aimlessly. It's mean. It's loud. It's necessary.

## 🔥 What It Does

Shame Meter is your toxic digital accountability buddy.

Once installed, it:

- Shows a sleek little box on every page you visit
- Tracks how long you've been staring at your screen
- Every 15 seconds, serves you a fresh roast hand-crafted to hurt your feelings
- Visually tracks your descent into time-wasting oblivion with a shame bar

You asked for motivation. This is tough love. You're welcome.

## 🗣️ Sample Roasts

Just a taste of what Shame Meter thinks of your scrolling habits:

- “You're not even procrastinating productively. This is just sad.”
- “Dreams? Goals? Nah, you chose this pit instead.”
- “You're the main character… in a cautionary tale.”
- “Hope you're proud of this legacy of scrolls.”

Yup.
